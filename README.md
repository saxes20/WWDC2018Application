# WWDC2018Application
In my playground, I built a story where the user is meant to recreate the logo of WWDC. However, it's not as simple as adding pictures to a background. Users must draw out each number and letter they would like to use in their logo, and then are able to select images to put in their logo. A neural network which I built will recognize the handwritten digits and characters in order to convert them to typed out numbers/letters to add onto the logo. Enjoy!
