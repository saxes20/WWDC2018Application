 # Welcome to my playground!
 
 Hello there! My name is Sameer Saxena, and I am currently a sophomore at the Episcopal Academy in Pennsylvania. I was introduced to programming in the sixth grade, and have been loving it ever since!
 
 I hope this project demonstrates my passion for computer science. I've always been more of a technical rather than creative guy, and I love learning about new products, new languages, new inventions, etc. in the technology world. Last year, I found that I could use my programming skills to capitalize on one of the hottest new trends of the past decade: machine learning. I've been experimenting and developing with it ever since, and I've found it really fun to make new models on any data I choose.
 
 For this playground I developed my first handwriting recognizer. It gave me many issues and took lots of time, but after getting past that I ended up with a model which could predict handwritten characters and digits with over 95% accuracy! This system forms the crux of my project, and is implemented a couple pages later. I hope you have fun with what I built!
